## Gates of Dawn - Haxe Edition

I've long been interested in languages for defining synthesizers.

The original Gates of Dawn was a Python library to generate Pure Data patches.

Now I have a new idea for some software for creating synths, which, as often interests me, will eventually be a mixture of linguistic and GUI.

I'm also getting interested in the Haxe language, because it can then be transpiled to various other languages and platforms where I want my code to run.

So that's what this project is ... Haxe code (written with the help of GPT4o, natch) to create synthesizers.

It's not really ready for public consumption yet. But I'm putting it here so I have access to from various machines.

You can safely ignore it unless you are particularly nosey.
